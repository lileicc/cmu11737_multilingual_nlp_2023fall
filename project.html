    <h1>Project</h1>
    <h2>Project Ideas</h2>
    <p>The following are possible ideas for project (but not limited to
      this). <br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Develop a working MT/ASR/TTS/ST system for some new (no
        high-quality available MT)&nbsp; and low-resource languages
        (e.g. Spanish-to-Tamil), explore and solve challenges along the
        way</li>
      <li>Improving methods to better utilize monolingual data</li>
      <li>Extending and improving Vocabulary and Tokenization for NMT</li>
      <li>Improving evaluation quality and efficiency, certain
        human-assisting tools for evaluation, conduct study.</li>
      <li>Computer-assisted and interactive translation methods</li>
      <li>MT for multimodal data, e.g. video translation, speech
        translation</li>
      <li>Integrating domain knowledge into MT/ASR/TTS system</li>
      <li>Novel hardware-based MT/ASR/TTS/ST system, e.g. Compress MT
        model to very small size and build a system (with inference but
        not training) on mobile phones, or extending existing CUDA
        library (e.g. LightSeq) to support more complex models.&nbsp; </li>
      <li>Extending a massive NMT (e.g. LegoMT) to a few more languages
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Project Proposal</h2>
    Please submit your project proposal (one submission per team and be
    sure to include all your teammates with the submission) to Canvas.
    The proposal document should be about 1 page (maximum of 2 pages).
    Be sure to describing the following elements:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>What research problem are you planning to address?</li>
      <li>What multilingual challenge(s) are you planning to address as
        part of this project?</li>
      <li>What are the existing state-of-art methods on this problem? Is
        the source code/model available?&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Possible directions for proposed method.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>What datasets are you planning to use? Please provide the link
        to the dataset accompanied by a small description. If you have
        yet to download the dataset, please explain any issues you may
        be having.</li>
      <li>What is the evaluation metric?</li>
      <li>Who is your team and how are you planning to split the
        workload between team members? Can you provide a rough
        timeline/milestones you plan to follow?</li>
      <li>What CPU, GPU and storage infrastructure do need for this
        project? Are you interested in using Amazon Web Services (AWS)
        or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) as part of your project? Please
        estimate the amount of computation time required. &nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    If you are unsure about what project to pick / need more information
    / want to discuss, Instructor/TAs are here to help you! Please come
    to office hour (as a group) to discuss about your proposal.&nbsp; <br>
