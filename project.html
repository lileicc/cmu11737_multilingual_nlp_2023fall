    <h1>Project</h1>
    <h2>Project Ideas</h2>
    <p>The following are possible ideas for project (but not limited to
      this). <br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Develop a working MT/ASR/TTS/ST system for some new (no
        high-quality available MT)&nbsp; and low-resource languages
        (e.g. Spanish-to-Tamil), explore and solve challenges along the
        way</li>
      <li>Improving methods to better utilize monolingual data</li>
      <li>Extending and improving Vocabulary and Tokenization for NMT</li>
      <li>Improving evaluation quality and efficiency, certain
        human-assisting tools for evaluation, conduct study.</li>
      <li>Computer-assisted and interactive translation methods</li>
      <li>MT for multimodal data, e.g. video translation, speech
        translation</li>
      <li>Integrating domain knowledge into MT/ASR/TTS system</li>
      <li>Novel hardware-based MT/ASR/TTS/ST system, e.g. Compress MT
        model to very small size and build a system (with inference but
        not training) on mobile phones, or extending existing CUDA
        library (e.g. LightSeq) to support more complex models.&nbsp; </li>
      <li>Extending a massive NMT (e.g. LegoMT) to a few more languages
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Project Proposal</h2>
    Please submit your project proposal (one submission per team and be
    sure to include all your teammates with the submission) to Canvas.
    The proposal document should be about 1 page (maximum of 2 pages).
    Be sure to describing the following elements:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>What research problem are you planning to address?</li>
      <li>What multilingual challenge(s) are you planning to address as
        part of this project?</li>
      <li>What are the existing state-of-art methods on this problem? Is
        the source code/model available?&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Possible directions for proposed method.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>What datasets are you planning to use? Please provide the link
        to the dataset accompanied by a small description. If you have
        yet to download the dataset, please explain any issues you may
        be having.</li>
      <li>What is the evaluation metric?</li>
      <li>Who is your team and how are you planning to split the
        workload between team members? Can you provide a rough
        timeline/milestones you plan to follow?</li>
      <li>What CPU, GPU and storage infrastructure do need for this
        project? Are you interested in using Amazon Web Services (AWS)
        or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) as part of your project? Please
        estimate the amount of computation time required. &nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Project Final Report</h2>
    The final report is intended to be structured as a
    workshop/conference paper, as mentioned in the first lecture slides.
    Y'all may have gotten an idea of the typical sections involved in a
    paper in HW3. Nonetheless, to help with the broad sections typically
    involved in a research paper, please see below:
    Kindly note that this is meant as a guide, and you can be flexible
    in case you have experience writing research papers. There is an
    upper-limit cap of 8 pages and Appendix length is unrestricted.<br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Introduction/Motivation</b>
        This essentially lays out the motivation for the problem, talks
        about why we need to work on it, the key contributions presented
        in the work. <br>
      </li>
      <li><b>Related Work/Background</b>
        This talks about key papers/works that provide context to your
        current work. Instead of listing down multiple past works, talk
        about the ones that minimally differ from your work, and how. <br>
      </li>
      <li><b>Methodology</b>
        This section talks about your method, raises research questions
        and how you are going to address them.
        Experimental Section/Results
        This section can describe your experiments and the results you
        obtain. <br>
      </li>
      <li><b>Experiments</b> can also be merged with the methodology
        section if that is more appropriate. <br>
      </li>
      <li><b>Analysis/Ablations</b>
        Typically, you would have multiple factors involved in your
        experimental setting. Analysis sections help you probe deeper
        into the results and help piece out contributions from
        individual modeling decisions made. <br>
      </li>
      <li><b>Conclusion/Discussion</b>
        This would list the main takeaways from your work, discuss some
        future ideas (if any) and engage in discussion. <br>
      </li>
      <li><b>Limitations
        </b>This section lays out some known limitations of your work. <br>
      </li>
      <li><b>[Project Only] Team Member Contributions</b>
        List out each individual's contributions in this section. <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    Kindly make note of the grading scheme that will be followed for the
    project. Please note that each project is different so some things
    can be subjective (especially in the A to A+ range). However, we
    will try our best to follow this scheme: <br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>A+</b>: A respectable research contribution that is novel
        and effective, and could be submitted largely as-is as a paper
        to an academic conference. All elements above are high quality.
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><b>A</b>: A respectable contribution that is largely complete
        and promising, but the description, sophistication of
        methodology, experiments, or analysis are not as fleshed out and
        complete as A+ assignments. <br>
      </li>
      <li><b>A-</b>: All required elements are present, but one or more
        are lacking to some extent. <br>
      </li>
      <li><b>B+ or B</b>: The project is complete, but one or more of
        the required elements is seriously lacking. <br>
      </li>
      <li><b>B- or below</b>: The project or description thereof is
        seriously incomplete. </li>
    </ul>
    If you are unsure about what project to pick / need more information
    / want to discuss, Instructor/TAs are here to help you! Please come
    to office hour (as a group) to discuss about your proposal.&nbsp; <br>
