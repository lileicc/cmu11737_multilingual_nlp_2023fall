@article{cattoni2021must,
 abstract = {End-to-end spoken language translation (SLT) has recently gained popularity thanks to the advancement of sequence to sequence learning in its two parent tasks: automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT). However, research in the field has to confront with the scarcity of publicly available corpora to train data-hungry neural networks. Indeed, while traditional cascade solutions can build on sizable ASR and MT training data for a variety of languages, the available SLT corpora suitable for end-to-end training are few, typically small and of limited language coverage. We contribute to fill this gap by presenting MuST-C, a large and freely available Multilingual Speech Translation Corpus built from English TED Talks. Its unique features include: i) language coverage and diversity (from English into 14 languages from different families), ii) size (at least 237 hours of transcribed recordings per language, 430 on average), iii) variety of topics and speakers, and iv) data quality. Besides describing the corpus creation methodology and discussing the outcomes of empirical and manual quality evaluations, we present baseline results computed with strong systems on each language direction covered by MuST-C.},

@inproceedings{zheng2020mirror,
 abstract = {Training neural machine translation models (NMT) requires a large amount of parallel corpus, which is scarce for many language pairs. However, raw non-parallel corpora are often easy to obtain. Existing approaches have not exploited the full potential of non-parallel bilingual data either in training or decoding. In this paper, we propose the mirror-generative NMT (MGNMT), a single unified architecture that simultaneously integrates the source to target translation model, the target to source translation model, and two language models. Both translation models and language models share the same latent semantic space, therefore both translation directions can learn from non-parallel data more effectively. Besides, the translation models and language models can collaborate together during decoding. Our experiments show that the proposed MGNMT consistently outperforms existing approaches in all a variety of scenarios and language pairs, including resource-rich and low-resource languages.},

@article{dabre2020survey,
 abstract = {We present a survey on multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT), which has gained a lot of traction in recent years. MNMT has been useful in improving translation quality as a result of translation knowledge transfer (transfer learning). MNMT is more promising and interesting than its statistical machine translation counterpart, because end-to-end modeling and distributed representations open new avenues for research on machine translation. Many approaches have been proposed to exploit multilingual parallel corpora for improving translation quality. However, the lack of a comprehensive survey makes it difficult to determine which approaches are promising and, hence, deserve further exploration. In this article, we present an in-depth survey of existing literature on MNMT. We first categorize various approaches based on their central use-case and then further categorize them based on resource scenarios, underlying modeling principles, core-issues, and challenges. Wherever possible, we address the strengths and weaknesses of several techniques by comparing them with each other. We also discuss the future directions for MNMT. This article is aimed towards both beginners and experts in NMT. We hope this article will serve as a starting point as well as a source of new ideas for researchers and engineers interested in MNMT.},

Our framework leverages recent breakthroughs in cross-lingual pretrained language modeling resulting in highly multilingual and adaptable MT evaluation models that exploit information from both the source input and a target-language reference translation in order to more accurately predict MT quality. To showcase our framework, we train three models with different types of human judgements: Direct Assessments, Human-mediated Translation Edit Rate and Multidimensional Quality Metric. Our models achieve new state-of-the-art performance on the WMT 2019 Metrics shared task and demonstrate robustness to high-performing systems.},

Yet, evaluation metrics have lagged behind, as the most popular choices (e.g., BLEU and ROUGE) may correlate poorly with human judgment. We propose BLEURT, a learned evaluation metric for English based on BERT. BLEURT can model human judgment with a few thousand possibly biased training examples. A key aspect of our approach is a novel pre-training scheme that uses millions of synthetic examples to help the model generalize. BLEURT provides state-of-the-art results on the last three years of the WMT Metrics shared task and the WebNLG data set. In contrast to a vanilla BERT-based approach, it yields superior results even when the training data is scarce and out-of-distribution.},

Although many advanced techniques are proposed to improve its generation quality, they still need the help of an autoregressive model for training to overcome the one-to-many multi-modal phenomenon in the dataset, limiting their applications. In this paper, we propose latent-GLAT, which employs the discrete latent variables to capture word categorical information and invoke an advanced curriculum learning technique, alleviating the multi-modality problem. Experiment results show that our method outperforms strong baselines without the help of an autoregressive model, which further broadens the application scenarios of the parallel decoding paradigm.},
